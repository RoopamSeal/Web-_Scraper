# Web-_Scraper

This project is a Python web scraper that extracts product data from Amazon. It uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML and retrieve information such as title, price, rating, reviews, and availability. The scraped data is organized into a Pandas DataFrame and saved to a CSV file named "amazon_data.csv". The scraper handles missing data gracefully and focuses on PlayStation 4 listings.
